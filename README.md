## 🎯 Overview

This is a two-player Tic Tac Toe game where players take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid. The goal is to get three of your marks (`X` or `O`) in a row—horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game also checks for ties when the grid is full.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Game Setup**: The game starts with an empty 3x3 grid.
2. **Player Moves**: Players take turns entering their moves by specifying the **row** and **column** where they want to place their mark (`X` or `O`).
3. **Input Format**: Players input their moves in the format `row, col` (e.g., `1, 2` for row 1, column 2).
4. **Win/Tie Check**: After each move, the game checks if there is a winner or if the game has ended in a tie.
5. **Game End**: The game ends when a player wins or the grid is full (tie).
